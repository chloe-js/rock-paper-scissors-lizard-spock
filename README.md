ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK

the purpose of this site is to make a presentation of interactive data. It is an interactive front-end websit. its is responsive to my users actions. it allows them to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to and this helps to achive our goal to having our user either win or loose the RPSLS game.
the main technologies used were HTML,CSS and Javascript.

Our external users gaols were to play an online game, Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, which has an element of chance.

Our site owners goal was to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to keep our online user enertained.
We have done this with including patteren matching functionality where the hand the user chooses is compared to the opponent. computers random choice, if it is either the same, it will then be a draw and no points given, and if the chosen hand is the stronger hand then the user will recieve a point and if it is weaker then the computer will recieve a point. 
The challenge is to be the first to 5 points. we can keep track of the users and the computers points with the allocated score board and we are suggested to the winner of the hand by a pop up alert indicating the winner.
