Development Life Cycle
The progress and process of this project took many different shapes and sizes throughout, originally taking life as a completely seperate repo named MS1 Tarbh Dubh Muay Thai. However early on, due to lessons learned and general frustrations, I felt it would be better to start anew on a different repo.

This section is to document and show the development process of this project, adhering to the user goals/stories and wireframes established earlier in this README doc.

Header & Footer Draft 1
Header & Footer Draft 1 The first sections I decided to work on were the header & footer. Originally taking life in the seperate aforementioned repo, we can see the overall nav elements, Google map iframe, contact info and social media links taking shape early.

Header Draft 1.5
Header Draft 1.5 Moving on to the next stage, the anchor nav and vid feature were added. The purpose of the anchor nav was to help guide users across a heavily content populated homepage. The vid was introduced to help create more user engagement and attempting to adhere to 5 Sec Test

The about us adopted the use of Bootstraps grid system to allow for responsive design across different platforms. Content borrowed from Fight City Gym and referenced in Credits section under Content.

Schedule and Pricing Draft 1.5
Schedule and Pricing Draft 1.5 The schedule and pricing section took the most time and change throughout development cycle. From the get go I wanted the schedule to be easy to read and find to allow users quick access to class times. Initially the table feature from bootstrap was used but as can be seen by above screenshot this did not look well.

FAQ, Testimonials and Footer Draft 1.5
FAQ & Testimonials Draft 1.5 FAQ and testimonial sections did not begin to take shape until Draft 2. Footer section remained pretty much the same from Draft 1 apart from some tidying up of content.

Header & About Us Draft 2.0
Header Draft 2.0 Header Mob Draft 2.0 The Draft 2 of this project is where things began to take shape. Colour and further bespoke styling was used. The colour scheme of black and gold was adopted due to this colour scheme being synonymous with champion status in combat sports. For the header, gold text shadow was applied to the lettering to give the elements more character. In addition a hamburger toggler icon was added for mobile as well as a hero image that appears instead of the autoplay vid on desktop. The about us, a new background color and font color was applied.

Schedule and Pricing Draft 2.0
Schedule and Pricing Draft 2.0 In order to fix the schedule layout, I decided to move away from the table format and apply a grid format instead. Not only did this allow easy access to the class times, it also worked well on mobile and tablet. However, after much thought I felt that it appeared too cluttered. Therefore, this was to take one more change. The background styling of gold opacity applied to background image of gym was to try create more of a sense of immesion on the site. Had initial difficulties trying to make the h4 heading uneffected by opacity. Solution to this was discovered through youtuber Coder Coder. Referenced in Credits under content.

FAQ Draft 2.0
FAQ Draft 2.0 Content for FAQ section was taken from site Thai Works Gym, which has been referenced in Contents in Credit section. Through initial application I found that the content here too was cluttered and difficult to find your issue as a user. To get around this, collapsible button feature from Bootstrap was introduced. This not only cleaned up this section but also created user more engagement.

Testimonials Draft 2.0
Testimonials Draft 2.0 For this section, a carrousel feature was adopted from Bootstrap to allow for a steady flow of reviews from users to come through. I wanted only the reviews to appear they were moving so to do this I applied the same image behind each review. This allowed for the illusion that the testimonial cards were moving rather than the whole thing.

Footer Draft 2.0
Footer Draft 2.0 Similar to the header, the footer adopted gold text shadowing to create more visual emphasis. I wanted this gold to be bearly noticable so that it would catch the eye but the user would not immediately identify why that was.


Project Final Deploy and User Story Adherence
Header Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)

Header Mob Final Deploy Not deviating too much from Draft 2, the final deployment of the project included a better mobile visual as the Branding heading was overflowing as highlighted in testing. Final header allowed easy user navigation and access to important information from the beginning. Video in header gave new users a glimpse as to what Muay Thai is like.

About Us Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)
About Us Final Deploy The about us section saw little to no change from Draft 2 to Final Deploy. Final about us allowed user to know if joining Muay Thai gym is for them.

Schedule & Pricing Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)

Finally. After much trial and error, the Schedule and Pricing section was finally complete. After seeing how effective collapsible buttons were for the FAQ section I decided to implement something similar to this section. Not only did it clean up the clutter, it allowed for more user engagement and a more streamlined user experience.

Final Schedule & Pricing let users know what time the classes were on and the prices involved. This info is easily obtainable.

FAQs Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)

Very little change happened from Draft 2 to final deployment for this section.

Final FAQ allowed user to make informed decision if Muay thai is for them.

Testimonials Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)

The cards were made more rounded for final deployment. Majority of changes to this section occured on mobile and desktop to reduce clutter appearance when screen size was reduced (see Testing)

Final testimonial allowed user to see other users impression of service to see if this would be a good choice for them.

Gallery Page Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)
Gallery Page Final Deploy Gallery Page Mob Final Deploy

Gallery Page implements Bootstrap Grid system appearing as 4 column on large screens, 3/2 columns on tablet and single image on mobile device.

Final Gallery Page allowed new users to see the fun and work existing users are having in the gym.

Contact Page Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)
Contact Page Final Deploy Contact Page Mob Final Deploy

Contact page uses Bootstrap form features as well as some minor grid usage. For the form, user must fill out all details on form before being able to Send. Email must include @ email structure to allow for send. Tried to do same for cont number but unfortunately no success.

Thank You Page Final Deploy In addition to this, when user fills out form and clicks send, user is brought to a hidden page named thankyou.html which thanks user for their message and informs them that someone will be in contact shortly. This can be seen above.

Final Contact Page allowed users a way of easily contacting the gym for any follow up questions.

Footer Final Deploy (Desktop & Mobile)
Footer Final Deploy Footer Mob Final Deploy

The final deploy of the footer remained very close to Draft 2 with the main changes happening on mobile to allow for social media links to appear directly under the contact us information.

Final Footer allowed for user to see exact location of the gym and contact info of gym and every page of website experience. Also allowed user to get through to gym social media accounts.

Edit was to change repo name from Cathals Playground to MS1-TDMT-Gym and to fix grammatical errors in this README file.

Edit was made to video html code to add controls to video in accordance with assignment marking guide.

Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from many sources however mainly from my own interest in Muay Thai and lofty dreams to open my own gym some day.

The name Tarbh Dubh is an irish name which translates as Black Bull. The inspiration behind this name is derived from the following:

This year marks the chinese new year of the ox/Bull
The name Black Bulls is a fictional team name of group in anime/manga series Black Clover.
My family home is in place called Templenaboe which translates as Temple of the Cow.
The color scheme of black and gold is synonymous with champion status in Muay thai and combat sports so wanted to preserve this with the project.
