# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK

The purpose of this site is to make a game of chance that has interactive data that has increasing challenges which keeps the user entertained. The site is an interactive front-end website and the main technologies used were HTML,CSS and Javascript. RPSLS is a site that demonstrates how pure javascript works in real world context. 
Its is responsive to my users actions and allows them to actively engage with data and alter the way the site displays the information. This helps to achive our goal to having our user either win or loose the RPSLS game.

This website game is targeted towards people who have a bit of free time and want to test their luck with playing a hand of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock which is an advanced version of the clasic hand gesture game, Rock, Paper Scissors.
Our external users gaols were to play an online game, Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, which has an element of chance.


Our site owners goal was to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to keep our online user enertained.
We have done this with including patteren matching functionality where the hand the user chooses is compared to the opponent. computers random choice, if it is either the same, it will then be a draw and no points given, and if the chosen hand is the stronger hand then the user will recieve a point and if it is weaker then the computer will recieve a point. 
The challenge is to be the first to 5 points. we can keep track of the users and the computers points with the allocated score board and we are suggested to the winner of the hand by a pop up alert indicating the winner.

The purpose of this project is the create an online platform for Tarbh Dubh Muay Thai to provide it users a way of being able to interact with the gym and find important information regarding class schedule, resources on offer, membership plans/prices, contact info, address etc.

In addition, this is also for Tarbh Dubh Muay Thai to allow them to have a presence online and help drive more members and inquiries to join. It will do this by highlighting the excitement of muay thai and the health benefits it offers while traversing through an easy to navigate website.

UX
The UX for this project will be investigated through the following five planes:
Strategy Plane:
Business goals?
The main goal of the business is to increase the amount of new members coming to the gym and help retain the existing members.

Why are we special? Who are competitors? What are they doing?
Within the Dublin area, the main competitor is SBG Ireland and Origins Muay Thai. Near my own home Carlow Muay Thai is the main competitor however do not have an online presence.

Tech considerations?
Building for mobile demographic or scientific/formal demographic? Website will need to be well optimized for mobile as we suspect majority of users will be those on the go.

Why would a user want this?
Existing User would want this to check opening times, class schedules and contact information. New user would also want to check the aforementioned but also price and location

Who is my target audience?
Target audience are customers that are looking to learn muay thai/self-defence, get fit and lose weight.

When you go to a particular site, where do you go first?
Existing customers want to see contact info, schedule times and contact info. New users want to be engaged immediately but also be able to see where price and location is. Muay thai is very niche so a FAQ section may also proof to be beneficial

Why do you go there in particular?
To check opening times, schedule, contact, location and prices

What makes a good experience?
Ease of access to information needs to be paramount which means a simple site structure. To attract new users to join, the site needs to be catchy and engaging from the jump.

What experiences are compelling to them?
Seeing existing members having fun and working hard to achieve their fitness goals.

How is our offering, or proposed offering, different from our competitors and substitutes?
As it stands, no competitors are highlighting schedules or prices from the get go, which will be what new users are wanting to know. In addition, no competitors are offering any sort of notable engagement to attract new customers. Therefore, when a user comes on to site I want them to be engaged immediately, see all vital information and be able to see why doing muay thai is beneficial for them.

Version Control
Git & GitHub
I used GitPod as a local repository and IDE and GitHub as a remote repository. The process of version control was:
First i created a new repository on GitHub
I have then opened that repository on GitPod and started coding
In GitPod i have created all the pages and and folders
I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
Process for saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository goes as follows (done in terminal):
git add . for adding work to git
git commit -m "Commit message" to commit the work on the stage
git push to update work to GitHub
